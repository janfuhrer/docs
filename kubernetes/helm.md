## delete pvc on helm uninstall
By a `helm uninstall` PVCs only are deleted, if they are part of a **Deployment**. PVCs of a **Statefulset** are **not** deleted, there is no way with the helm-command (f.e. `--purge`) â†’ Issue: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5156

If we want helm not to delete a pvc from a deployment, we can use the annotation `"helm.sh/resource-policy": keep` (https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#tell-helm-not-to-uninstall-a-resource)
