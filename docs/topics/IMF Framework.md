IMF stands for "**Index** and **Maps of Content**, and other fluid **Frameworks**".

## Why IMF?

Equipping your library with an Index, Maps, and other fluid Frameworks enhances your working experience. It is robust, flexible, and able to match your changing needs.

## What is IMF

1. **The Index** - This can act as your homebase to ground you, and as a launching pad into your note library.
2. **Maps of Content** (MOCs) - These are like having curated worktables with all your relevant index cards placed on them. They are the mitochondria of a digital library. Once you use them, you'll be able to overcome the overwhelm that arises from having notes scattered everywhere.
3. **Other Fluid Frameworks** -  Adding structure to your notes has gotten a bad rap lately. But if you know how to keep your structures fluid, you'll get the best of both worlds: order *and* chaos; excellent note retrieval *and* the serendipity of discovery.

## Structure

**Map of Content = MOC** - Use these to structure your digital library

**Table of Contents = TOC** - Use these to structure more specific, near-final projects in a single, linear way

### MOC

- MOCs are “overlays” that add relevant information but that don't affect the base content. 
- MOCs are not hierarchical like a table of contents. They are [heterarchial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy). Meaning, you can have multiple maps organizing the same info in different ways to fit whatever persepective the note is for.
